		<li class="blank">"Natural-language understanding is sometimes referred to as an AI-complete problem, because natural-language recognition seems to require extensive knowledge about the outside world and the ability to manipulate it. The definition of "understanding" is one of the major problems in natural-language processing."</li>
		<li class="blank"><h2>our approach</h2></li>
		<li class="blank">Emoome is a project that seeks to provide a useful data set of human-word behavior/emotion relationships that are machine readable and semantically linked that in the future could be used to help write more accurate NLP algorithms and libraries.</li>
		<li class="blank">Once written these NLP too could be implemented as layer in any application that deals with natural language processing.</li>
		<li class="blank"><h2>fun & helpful</h2></li>
		<li class="blank">In the short term Emoome is a personal metrics application that helps people keep track of their emotions and actions by making contributing data to computer science a rewarding experience.</li>
